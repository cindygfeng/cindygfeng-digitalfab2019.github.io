            <h1>Cindy Feng's Assignment 1</h1>
            <p>
                This assignment was completed in the MILL on 04/11/2019.

                I first started by measuring out the sheet of cardboard with my calipers, which read 0.155 inches.

                I borrowed a laptop from the MILL to use Adobe Illustrator to draw a shape that I could lasercut.  I did not know how to use Illustrator, so I asked D'Marcus to help me.  I made the size of the sheet the same dimensions as the bed of one of the lasercutters in the MILL, 32"x18".  D'Marcus helped me draw a 6" by 2" rectangle, with 6 0.2" wide slots. For some reason, I thought the slots had to be slightly larger than the cardboard.  I also chamfered the corners of the rectangle.  I copied the rectangle twice as a test run for my first lasercut attempt.

                I returned during Josh's office hours at 5:00 on 04/11/2019 to print.  Josh helped me set up the cardboard in the lasercutter, connect the laptop with the Illustrator file, and print it.  The machine settings were provided by Josh in his powerpoint, 25% speed and 100% power.

                However, with 0.2" wide slots, the cardboard did not fit together.  The two pieces would fall apart loosely.  So I decided to redraw the rectangle with 0.15" slots, which fit a lot better.  I print these out four at at a time. Adobe Illustrator file <a href="Assignment1/laser_cutter_repeating_shapes_version2.ai">here</a>.  Image from unloading the Lasercutter below.

            </p>
            <p>
                I then took the original Illustrator file with 4 shapes and shifted the shapes over by 7 inches to print another 4.

            </p>
            <p>
                I printed 8 pieces on the first sheet of cardboard, 4 more pieces on cardboard from the same cardboard box.  The 12 final pieces are on the left below.  On the right are the 2 cardboard pieces with slots that were too wide, so the pieces did not stay together.

            <p>
                I then took the pieces home to assemble them! They did not come apart when I shook them. Assembly below, but I had to disassemble it to take it back to class.
