            <p>
                This assignment was completed in the MILL on 04/11/2019.

                I first started by measuring out the sheet of cardboard with my calipers, which read 0.155 inches.

                I borrowed a laptop from the MILL to use Adobe Illustrator to draw a shape that I could lasercut.  I did not know how to use Illustrator, so I asked D'Marcus to help me.  I drew a 6" by 2" rectangle, with 6 0.2" wide slots. For some reason, I thought the slots had to be slightly larger than the cardboard.  I also chamfered the corners of the rectangle.  I copied the rectangle twice.

                I returned during Josh's office hours at 5:00 on 04/11/2019 to print.  Josh helped me set up the cardboard in the lasercutter and then I ran it.  However, with 0.2" wide slots, the cardboard did not fit together.  The two pieces would fall apart loosely.  So I decided to redraw the rectangle with 0.15" slots, which fit a lot better.  I print these out four at at a time.  Image from unloading the Lasercutter below.

            <p>
                I printed 8 pieces on the first sheet of cardboard, and 4 more pieces on cardboard from the same cardboard box.  The 12 final pieces are on the left below.  On the right are the 2 cardboard pieces with slots that were too wide, so the pieces did not stay together.

                I then took the pieces home to assemble them! Assembly below, but I had to disassemble it to take it back to class.
