            <h1>Cindy Feng's Final Project Proposal</h1>
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                I knew I wanted to do a clock, but after an hour of searching for a simple DIY gravity-powered clock, I found myself searching videos of escapement mechanisms that could be adapted for a clock build later on.  I didn't want to overload myself with creating a perfectly accurate clock for this final project.  <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Clock-Escapement/">This</a> is what came up after I searched for clock pendulum mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
                This instructables was taken from a UCSD tutorial for how to create this clock for an undergraduate class, but I plan on using the CAD models that are offered to UCSD mechanical engineering undergrad students to complete this projet, and add my own creative flair!  Here's a video from the source instructables just to convey what I will be trying to do:
            </p>

            <p>
                The basic concept is that a weight on a wound string attached to the wheel axis causes the wheel to spin, but the pendulum teeth prevents the gear from spinning freely, so it "ticks."  This is a simple escapement mechanism that is gravity-powered and is the basic concept behind pendulum clocks!
            </p>
            <p>
                Because this project is just a demonstration of an escapement mechanism, the intended use case is to be a wall or tabletop decoration.  Applications of escapement mechanisms in everyday objects are clocks, metronomes, motors, things that "tick"!  With accurate gear ratios, I could turn this project into a clock in the future!
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to see if I could come up with a different design than what was given to UCSD MAE students.  I decided I wanted the weight that coils the wheel to be seen, so I decided to draw it off to one side and still causing the wheel to spin.

            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted most of the pieces to be acrylic, but I also wanted to use the extra materials I already bought for this class -- FR1, oomoo silicon, and plaster.  Therefore, I decided the escapement wheel and the pendulum would be acrylic, probably 3/8" which I would procure from the MILL, and the weight would be made of plaster molded from the silicone mold! The bearing and fasteners I believe I will just get from Fluke. I am still deciding how to use the FR1... I originally wanted to add a PCB component but I think that is too ambitious.

            </p>
            <p>
                However, my backup plan is just to stick with the dimensions drawn out in the instructables tutorial!  Or to just take the dxf from the tutorial and modify it.

            <h2>Tasks and Timeline</h2>
            <p>
                Given that is now Wednesday and I have not started on this project, I am breaking down my tasks by day until the last class:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wednesday: Purchase acrylic from the MILL. See if Fluke carries shafts/bearings</li>
                    <li>Thursday-Sunday: CAD modeling and design.  Molding and casting at home.</li>
                    <li>Monday: Fabrication -- Laser cutting of acrylic.  Contingency plan: 3D printing with purchased filament from the MILL/Fluke</li>
                    <li>Tuesday: Assembly and finishing in Fluke</li>
                    <li>Wednesday before class: Buffer time and any last minute finishing!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                My general contingency plan is if any parts fail, my CAD design will be good enough so I can 3D print it!  I am honestly worried that there will be a lot of students on Monday and Tuesday in the makerspaces working on their projects, so I am planning on taking Monday off work to spend in the MILL and hop on a laser cutter when possible.

            <h2>Bill of Materials</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>

                    <li>shafts, bearings, and fasteners from Fluke (need to check what sizes they have) to be obtained/purchased Wednesday</li>
                    <li>string from home</li>
                    <li>Oomoo 2-part silicon and plaster, already procured</li>
