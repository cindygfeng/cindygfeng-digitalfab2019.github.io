                My name is Cindy Feng! I want to build on my digital fabrication experience, which includes 3D printing, molding/casting, milling, and using machine shop tools from my undergrad coursework and job as a mechanical engineer.  I can teach my peers any of those digital fabrication techniques, however I want to learn more graphic design software and techniques.
