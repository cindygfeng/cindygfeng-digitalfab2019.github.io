                    I am a mechanical engineer at Boeing and a 2nd year HCDE Masters student.  This quarter I am taking a HCDE 598 class called Digital Fabrication.  I already have experience, but I want to refresh and build on my 3D printing, molding/casting, milling, and machine shop skills. I can teach my peers any of those digital fabrication techniques, however I want to learn more graphic design software and techniques, and I am new at GitHub and HTML.

                    Here is a photo of me from the final project showcase when I took HCDE 539: Physical Prototyping.  I built a mock up of a wind tunnel.
