            <h1>Cindy Feng's Final Project</h1>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                Starting point for inspiration: <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Clock-Escapement/">https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Clock-Escapement/</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                As a recap of my <a href="finalprojectproposal.html">project proposal</a>, I took the above instructables for a 3D printed clock escapement mechanism, found the source link from UC San Diego for how to build a clock project, and sketched out what I wanted my project to look like.

            <h2>CAD Design</h2>
            <p>
                I followed the instructions for how to draw the escapement wheel and pendulum here: <a href="http://mae3.eng.ucsd.edu/clock-project/drawing-th">http://mae3.eng.ucsd.edu/clock-project/drawing-th</a>.  I used Onshape to draw these shapes, and then I extracted the faces as .dxfs for cutting.

            <p>
                For the pendulum, I decided to freehand splice an octopus, while maintaining the top geometry of the pendulum.  I used the provided sketch to add my own creative flair to the pendulum.

            <h2>Materials</h2>
            <p>
                Procuring materials was a journey! I originally bought some 0.25" thick wood from the MILL, which was super smokey after it was lasercut.  Since I did not like the finish of the wood, I decided I would cut the pieces out of 0.25" acrylic, and use the wood pieces as backup.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="final/Lasercutter_wood.jpg" width=600>
            </p>
            <p>
                I also ran to TAP Plastics store to buy what I thought was 0.25" acrylic, which ended up being 0.25" polycarbonate, so I found out I could not lasercut this material.  I ended up switching to 0.125" acrylic because that is what was available, but it ended up being too light, and causing problems later on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the specifications for the Epilog lasercutter for 0.125" acrylic, I used <b>2% speed, 100% power, and 100 freq</b>.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                I also needed a weight to spin my escape wheel.  In order to use another fabrication method, I wanted to cast a fridge magnet that I had.  However, the process did not go according to plan.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Because of the magnet on the back that I could not pop off, I opted to dip the magnet into silicon and suspend it with another magnet.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                The mold had too many air bubbles so it was not a good mold of the original magnet.  I also feared the plaster would be too light.  So I opted to take the machineable wax that I had from a previous assignment that had climbing holds, and mill out the climbing holds to make a solid silicone block that would serve as a weight for the system.

            <h2>Fabrication</h2>
            <p>
                I had to put the upright onto a stand, so I got a scrap piece of wood and some L brackets and fasteners, and used a powerdrill to put it together.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                The screws stuck out of the base! So I used a hacksaw in the Mill to cut off the extra thread.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                I went to my local hardware store and bought a clevis pin and a collar with a set screw.  I also picked up thread and a plastic flange bearing.  I hammered the flange bearing into the holding fixture.

            </p>
            <p>
                I also bought a steel rod and hammered it into the acrylic escapement wheel, which cracked.
