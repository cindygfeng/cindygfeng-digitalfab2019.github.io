            <h2>Learning Grasshopper</h2>
            <p>
                With no prior experience with Grasshopper and some experience with Rhino, I took to my laptop to just familiarize myself with Grasshopper.  Some progress shots and lessons learned:
            </p>
            <p><p>
                Familiarizing myself with the interface.  I spent a while with Kim Dziubinski in the MILL trying to figure out how to remove branches.  Overall I picked up Grasshopper pretty quickly and created a network of inputs and outputs. The user interface definitely needs some work, but I know that 3D CAD software does not undergo much usability testing.

            </p>
            <p>
                In order to assign a I got very confused by the number icon, which read a number "7", so I found out I had to go into the display settings to uncheck "Draw Icons" in order to change the text on the integer parameter to "2".

            </p>
            <p>
                I created number sliders for the thickness of the cardboard, and the length of the recangular slots in a polar array in a polygon. I soon decided I wanted to control the number of sides of a polygon with a control knob.  Here is what I started with, a hexagon.  The branches started to get complicated.

            </p>
            <p>
                I then wanted the number of slots to also be controlled by the knob, and here is where I did some math to find out by what angle the original rectangle would have to rotate about the origin to stay centered on a flat side of the polygon.  I noticed that the polygon held the 90 degree point whenever I changed the number of sides.  The last step was figuring out that the rotation function in Grasshopper rotates in a counterclockwise direction by default, so I had to negate the radian values.  The equation was -pi/4 + -2*pi/(# of polygon sides).

            </p>
            <p>
                I was super close! Just some minor debugging and then I added a rectangular array to print 3 rows of 4 shapes.
            </p>
            <h2>Grasshopper and Rhino Output</h2>
            <p>
                The final Grasshopper layout is below.  I tried cleaning up the branches a bit, but this was the best I could do.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="Assignment2_Grasshopper_Screenshot_final.jpg" width=1000></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                And here is the resulting Rhino output for 6 sides:

            </p>
            <p>
                Rhino output for 10 sides:

            </p>
            <h2>Lasercut Output</h2>
            <p>
                Because I only had the CAD model for the hexagon shape while at the MILL, I only lasercut hexagons.  I used three thicknesses of cardboard total for this assignment.  The first was 0.16" corrugated cardboard.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p> 
                The second was 0.02" thick cardboard (La Croix canned soda container).
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="Assignment2_3_LaCroixboxincutter.jpg" width=400></a>
            <p>
                Since I was worried this would be too flimsy, I printed on a 3rd material using Kim's white cardboard.
            </p>

            <h2>Assemblies That Do Not Come Apart with a Light Shaking!</h2>
            <p>

                </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
                I found that the LaCroix cardboard was too flimsy and would flop around when I shook it, so it was a good thing I had Kim's cardboard as a backup.
